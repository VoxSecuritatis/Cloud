# Cloud

## Objective

This repository serves as a resource for exploring Cloud Computing through operational tools, educational materials, and practical implementations. It includes automation scripts, cloud-based applications, and tutorials designed to enhance understanding and application of cloud computing concepts. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience while showcasing real-world cloud solutions and use cases.

## Skills Learned

- Cloud (AWS) Services – Utilizing AWS cloud infrastructure and services to deploy, manage, and scale cloud-based applications.  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Implementing and managing cloud resources using automation tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.  
- Cloud Architecture and Design – Building secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions tailored to specific business needs.  
- Compute, Storage, and Networking – Leveraging AWS services for efficient resource management, data storage, and network configuration.  
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Managing user access, permissions, and roles to ensure secure and controlled access to AWS resources.  
- Security and Compliance – Understanding best practices for securing cloud environments and ensuring compliance with industry standards.  
- Monitoring and Optimization – Using cloud-native tools to monitor performance, optimize costs, and ensure operational efficiency.  
- Automation and DevOps – Automating deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and operational processes to streamline cloud operations.
